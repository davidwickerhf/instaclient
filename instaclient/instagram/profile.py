class Profile(InstaBaseObject):
    """Class reppresenting an Instagram profile.

    The instagram profile class inherits from the `instagram.InstaBaseObjects` class.
    This class should contain all methods related to actions that can be executed 
    on the profile page of a user on the Instagram website.

    Two `instagram.Profile` objects are considered equal if they share the 
    same ID or the same instagram username.

    Attributes:
        client (:class:`instaclient.InstaClient`): This is the client instance that 
            will be used to perform actions on the object. Many methods included in 
            this class are in fact shortcuts for the `instaclient.InstaClient` 's methods. 

        id (str): The unique ID of the profile, provided and defined by Instagram.

        viewer (str): The instagram account's username of the account the user is 
            currently logged in with, when loading this object from Instagram.

        username (str): The instagram profile's unique username.
            Note:
                Instagram usernames are mutable, so don't rely on them too much for 
                persistence. The instagram ID won't change when a user changes the 
                account's username.

        name (str, optional): The instagram profile's name, seen at the top of the 
            profile page, under the profile picture and over the bio. Defaults to None.
            Note: 
                Special characters, such as emojis, might be saved in unicode notation.

        biography (str, optional): The profile's bio. Also in this case, special 
            characters might be translated into unicode. Defaults to None.

        is_private (bool, optional): Variable retreived from Instagram. 
            Is `True` if the profile is private. Defaults to None.

        is_verified (bool, optional): Variable retreived from Instagram. 
            Is `True` if the profile is verified by instagram. Defaults to None.

        is_business_account (bool, optional): Variable retreived from Instagram. 
            Is `True` if the profile is a business account. Defaults to None.

        is_joined_recently (bool, optional): Variable retreived from Instagram. 
            Is `True` if the profile has been created recently. Defaults to None.

        follower_count (int, optional): The number of followers the profile has. 
            Defaults to None.

        followed_count (int, optional): The number of accounts a profile follows. 
            Defaults to None.

        post_count (int, optional): The number of posts on the profile. Defaults to None.

        business_category_name (str, optional): If the profile is a business account,
            the business category's name is saved in this attribute. Defaults to None.

        overall_category_name (str, optional): If the user has defined a category 
            for the profile, the value of such category will be saved in this attribute. 
            Defaults to None.

        external_url (str, optional): Optional URL that the user might have placed 
            under the bio. Defaults to None.

        fb_id (str, optional): Optional ID of the connected Facebook Page
            This attribute is valid only if the user has connected the account 
            to FB. Defaults to None.

        profile_pic_url (str, optional): Optional url of the profile picture.

        business_email (str, optional): If the profile is a business account
            and if the email is set to be public, it will be saved in this attribute. 
            Defaults to None.

        follows_viewer (bool, optional): True if this profile follows the `viewer`.
            Defaults to None.

        followed_by_viewer (bool, optional): True if this profile is followed by the `viewer`.
            Defaults to None.

        blocked_by_viewer (bool, optional): Is true if the `viewer` is currently 
            blocked by this profile. Defaults to None.

        restricted_by_viewer (bool, optional): Is true if the `viewer` has restricted 
            this profile. Defaults to None.

        has_blocked_viewer (bool, optional): Is true if the `viewer` has blocked this 
            profile. Defaults to None.

        has_requested_viewer (bool, optional): Is true if the `viewer` was  sent a 
            follow request by this profile. Defaults to None.

        mutual_followed (int, optional): Number of mutual followers. Defaults to None.

        requested_by_viewer (bool, optional): Is try if the `viewer` has sent a 
            follow request to this profile. Defaults to None.

        Note:
            The attributes `blocked_by_viewer`, `restricted_by_viewer`, `has_blocked_viewer`, 
            `has_requested_viewer`, `mutual_followed` and `requested_by_viewer` all depend 
            on the `viewer` attribute.

            If this instagram object is loaded when the client is not signed in, these values 
            will be either set to None or False.
